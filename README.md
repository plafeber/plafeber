- 👋 Hello all, here I'm @plafeber.
- 👀 I teach "information science" which means I occupy myself with all kinds of knowledge around the topic of "information". Specifically, I work with Cakephp on my sites, I work with Wordpress, I teach programming in Python. I love logic, specifically with Prolog. I am experienced in organisational management (processes, quality, risk, control, culture and more). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate coding but also teaching information science.
- 📫 You can reach me through my website multi-grade.nl.
